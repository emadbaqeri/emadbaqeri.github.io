# Understanding Static Code Analysis

Have you noticed how Go and Rust codebases often share a distinctive, consistent appearance? From
indentation and variable naming to the absence of unused variables, this uniformity isn't
coincidental. It's primarily achieved through static code analysis, powered by either built-in
language tooling or community-developed solutions. For instance, Rust employs rustfmt while Go relies
on gofmt to maintain consistent code formatting.
But what about JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS? How do front-end developers ensure consistency
across their codebases?
The answer lies in utilizing a comprehensive suite of community-built tools that enforce consistent
rules across multiple aspects of development - from code style and indentation to filename conventions.
These tools help both current and future developers maintain a clean, consistent, and easily
maintainable codebase.
