description: Discover how to automate code quality in your Next.js projects using Biome for linting and formatting, Lefthook for git hooks, and Commitlint for structured commit messages. This guide provides a practical, seamless setup for maintaining a clean and consistent codebase.
---

After setting up a Next.js project in accordance with the provided documentation, I plan to select the default options for this application.

```sh
npx create-next-app@latest

✔ What do you want to name your project? … static-code-analysis
✔ Would you like to includeScript? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to add ESLint? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to implement Tailwind CSS? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to place your code in a `src/` directory? … No / Yes
✔ Would you prefer to use App Router? (recommended) … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to utilize Turbopack for `next dev`? … No / Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the import alias (`@/*` by default)? … No / Yes
```

I will utilize `biome` for comprehensive linting and formatting of the entire codebase, so let's proceed with the installation by following the instructions in the documentation.

```sh
pnpm add --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```

Once the installation is complete, we need to run the command below to configure biome.

```sh
pnpm biome init
```

This command will generate a `biome.json` file in the project's root directory, which will contain the content shown below. We will modify the default settings soon to suit our requirements.

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
	"vcs": {
		"enabled": false,
		"clientKind": "git",
		"useIgnoreFile": false
	},
	"files": {
		"ignoreUnknown": false,
		"ignore": []
	},
	"formatter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"indentStyle": "tab"
	},
	"organizeImports": {
		"enabled": true
	},
	"linter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"rules": {
			"recommended": true
		}
	},
	"javascript": {
		"formatter": {
			"quoteStyle": "double"
		}
	}
}
```

Having successfully installed `biomejs`, we will now utilize the biome CLI for formatting and linting our code. Let's modify the `package.json` file to add these two scripts:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"lint": "pnpm biome lint --write .",
		"format": "pnpm biome format --write ."
	}
}
```

Furthermore, we need to update the `biome.json` file to disregard files that our version control system—Git, in my case—excludes. To accomplish this, we enable the "vcs" option in the configuration and set `useIgnoreFile` to true.

```json
	"vcs": {
		"enabled": true,
		"clientKind": "git",
		"useIgnoreFile": true
	},
```

While the default rules will suffice for my projects, I will add one more rule to ensure consistent file naming: the `useFilenamingConvention` linting rule. The `biome.json` config file's linter object should currently appear as follows:

```json
	"linter": {
		"enabled": true,
		"rules": {
			"recommended": true
		}
	},
```

To ensure a uniform `kebab-case` naming for files throughout the project, we should modify this configuration as follows:

```json
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "style": {
        "useFilenamingConvention": {
          "level": "error",
          "options": {
            "filenameCases": ["kebab-case"],
            "strictCase": true,
            "requireAscii": true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
```

Let’s take a moment here – we've established our code quality tools, but that’s just part of the equation. These safeguards are only effective if we remember to use them. This is why **git hooks** transition from being technical details to crucial protection for your codebase. I've learned through experience that even the best linters can’t prevent human error—hence we are introducing **Lefthook** to automate our quality checks.

Why choose Lefthook instead of other git hook managers? Three compelling reasons:

1. **Incredible speed** (written in Go and executes hooks in parallel)
2. **No dependencies** (no Node.js bloat for our hooks)
3. **Straightforward configuration** (YAML files that anyone can grasp)

Let's get to work:

```sh
pnpm add @evilmartians/lefthook --save-dev
```

Next, create a `lefthook.yml` file at the root of your project:

```sh
# The conductor of our quality orchestra
pre-commit:
  parallel: true
  commands:
    lint:
      run: pnpm lint
    format:
      run: pnpm format

commit-msg:
  parallel: false
  commands:
    commitlint:
      run: npx commitlint --edit {1}
```

This setup does something remarkable – each time you commit:

1. **Pre-commit** (executed in parallel):
    - `lint`: Automatically fix whatever Biome can address
    - `format`: Correct any formatting issues
2. **Commit-msg**:
    - Ensures commit message structure using commitlint

Now let’s address the **atomic commit** enforcer. Atomic commits are akin to single-ingredient meals – each commit should accomplish one clear task. No "fixed multiple issues" messages allowed!



Install our commit message guardian:

```
pnpm add @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional --save-dev
```

Create the `commitlint.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  extends: ['@commitlint/config-conventional'],
  rules: {
    'type-enum': [2, 'always', ['feat', 'fix', 'docs', 'style', 'refactor', 'test', 'chore']],
    'subject-case': [2, 'always', 'lower-case']
  }
};
```

This configuration enforces:

- Distinct commit types (feat/fix/docs/etc.)
- Lowercase subjects
- Structured message format

Try committing with an invalid message:

```
git commit -m "save my work"
# ⚠️ Fails with:
# ✖   subject may not be empty [subject-empty]
# ✖   type may not be empty [type-empty]
```

Now let's do it correctly:

```
git commit -m "chore: add commit message validation"
# ✅ Green light to commit!
```

The real magic occurs when you combine these tools:

1. Lefthook automatically triggers checks
2. Biome refines your code
3. Commitlint ensures meaningful commits
4. Result: Each commit evolves into a reliable building block

This setup isn't about creating red tape—it's focused on building muscle memory. After a week, you'll instinctively write improved commits and cleaner code. The best part? It scales wonderfully—when your team expands, these checks will become your collective standard for quality.
